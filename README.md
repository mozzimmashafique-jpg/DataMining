Casual Loop Diagram 

This repository contains allfiles used to generate a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) for the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) traffic congestion system.
The diagram is part of a university systems-thinking project (MBA K723 – Phase Three) where the goal is to map the feedback loops

The CLD helps visualize:

Reinforcing cycles such as Induced Demand

Housing-driven Suburban Sprawl

Balancing dynamics through Transit Mode Shift

This README explains the system structure, the included code, and how to generate the diagram yourself.sustaining chronic congestion.
